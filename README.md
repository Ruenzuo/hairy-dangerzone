iOS development tools repository
================================

__Getting started:__

> First, install the iOS SDK which is bundled with Xcode 5, the current version as I'm writing this. It's available on Mac App Store for free. Then you should start reading Programming with Objective-C, which is an excelent guide from Apple on how to use ObjC, iOS SDK main programming language. Then you have a lot of resources about diferent framework of the iOS SDK available at iOS Developer Center, but I would recommend to start with iOS Technology Overview, which explains the OS layers and the frameworks within each one. One important reading, even if you're not a UX professional, would be iOS Human Interface Guidelines, recently updated to iOS 7. Lastly, Apple recommends this document as the entry point for iOS developement, iOS App Programming Guide, excelent reading.
